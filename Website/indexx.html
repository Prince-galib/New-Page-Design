<p class="hy" style="text-align: center;">Bangladesh forms the sovereign part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, <br>which was divided during the Partition of India in 1947 as part of a Muslim union with Pakistan,<br> which it separated from in a bloody independence war in 1971.[21] The country has a Bengali Muslim majority. <br>Ancient Bengal was known as Gangaridai and was a bastion of pre-Islamic kingdoms. Muslim conquests after 1204 heralded the sultanate and Mughal periods, during which an independent Bengal Sultanate and a wealthy Mughal Bengal<br> transformed the region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy. After the Battle of Plassey in 1757,<br> the maximum extent of British Bengal stretched from the Khyber Pass in the west<br> to Singapore in the east.[22][23] The creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh.<br> The All India Muslim League was founded in Dhaka in 1906.[24] In 1940,<br> the first Prime Minister of Bengal, A. K. Fazlul Huq, supported the Lahore Resolution.<br>Before the partition of Bengal, a Bengali sovereign state was first proposed by premier H. S. Suhrawardy. <br>A referendum and the announcement of the Radcliffe Line established the present-day territorial boundary.</p>
